Data Post-Processing for TC timely experiements prior to
ingestion by R

Pass it full path to directory that contains test result
files to post-process

Example:

./tc_timely_data_post_processing.py ~/results/timeliness/statistical \
     /20160414211230/nmeta2-constrained-bw-iperf/20160414211648

This script is called by the Ansible YAML template, so does not need to
be run manually.
